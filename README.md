Saleor, based on Python and Django, the latest major update introduces a modular front end powered by a GraphQL API and written with React and TypeScript. This PWA has a dashboard for the store manager, and functionality that includes billing, shipping, receipts, multilingualism, product pagination, shopping cart,
payments APIs, geo-adaptivity, SEO, built-in server-side analytics, and more. Much of the functionality came out of the box, and the rest was
added manually, as well as the front-end storefront designed by hand.
